Based on where the cursor is, you can do one of the following:

**Evaluate Outermost Form**  
Default keybinding: `cmd-enter` (mac), `alt-enter` (windows)

**Evaluate Current Form**  
Default keybinding: `cmd-alt-enter` (mac), `alt-ctrl-enter` (windows)

**Evaluate Current Expression**  
Default keybinding: `ctrl-cmd-alt-enter` (mac), `shift-ctrl-alt-enter` (windows)

Please customize these keybindings to suit your needs.  

&nbsp;

Additionally, you can access all the Repl-Repl commands from the following places:  
- The application menu (top of the screen) *Packages > repl-repl > ...*  
- In the dropdown menu (when you click anywhere inside your file), under *repl-repl*  
- Open the command pallette (`cmd-shift-p`) and search for 'Repl Repl'
